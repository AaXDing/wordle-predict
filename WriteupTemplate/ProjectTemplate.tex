Use the section command like this to make sections in your report. You can also use sub-sections and sub-sub-sections.

\subsection{How to use bibtex for references}

Don't forget to cite things!!! Cite the original paper (if doing type 1 project), cite the textbook if you reference it for ideas, cite other papers if you use them for inspiration, cite links to data if you're using any. 


To cite things, add the bibtex entry to references.bib. 
Then using the bibtex ``key'' (the first thing in the bibtex entry) you can cite it using \cite{haberman_mathematical_1998} which adds the inline citation and adds it to the bibliography.
You can find bibtex entries from google scholar -- \href{https://libguides.usask.ca/c.php?g=218034&p=1445751}{this link shows you how}. 

You can refer to figures using their labels. For example, Figure \ref{fig:Bella} shows a picture of my dog, Bella.

Feel free to change any of the section names if appropriate and add subsections.
