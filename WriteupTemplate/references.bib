	title = {When zombies attack!: {Mathematical} modelling of an outbreak of zombie infection},
	abstract = {Zombies are a popular ﬁgure in pop culture/entertainment and they are usually portrayed as being brought about through an outbreak or epidemic. Consequently, we model a zombie attack, using biological assumptions based on popular zombie movies. We introduce a basic model for zombie infection, determine equilibria and their stability, and illustrate the outcome with numerical solutions. We then reﬁne the model to introduce a latent period of zombiﬁcation, whereby humans are infected, but not infectious, before becoming undead. We then modify the model to include the effects of possible quarantine or a cure. Finally, we examine the impact of regular, impulsive reductions in the number of zombies and derive conditions under which eradication can occur. We show that only quick, aggressive attacks can stave off the doomsday scenario: the collapse of society as zombies overtake us all.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.physa.2013.03.034},
	abstract = {We develop a mathematical model for mimicking the love story between Scarlett and Rhett described in ‘‘Gone with the Wind’’. In line with tradition in classical physics, the model is composed of two Ordinary Differential Equations, one for Scarlett and one for Rhett, which encapsulate their main psycho-physical characteristics. The two lovers are described as so-called insecure individuals because they respond very strongly to small involvements of the partner but then attenuate their reaction when the pressure exerted by the partner becomes too high. These characteristics of Scarlett and Rhett clearly emerge during the first part of the film and are sufficient to develop a model that perfectly predicts the complex evolution and the dramatic end of the love story. Since the predicted evolution of the romantic relationship is a direct consequence of the characters of the two individuals, the agreement between the model and the film supports the high credibility of the story. Although credibility of a fictitious story is not necessary from a purely artistic point of view, in most cases it is very appreciated, at the point of being essential in making the film popular. In conclusion, we can say that we have explained with a scientific approach why ‘‘Gone with the Wind’’ has become one of the most successful films of all times.},
